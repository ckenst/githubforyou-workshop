# Exercise 2, Branches Galore

This second exercise is the foundation of the GitHub workflow: branch, commit, pull request, merge, deploy. You can do all of this in your existing repository.

Objectives:
1. Create a new branch (in your local repository) e.g. `readme-edits`
2. Make some changes, commit and push those changes
3. Open a Pull Request
4. Merge the Pull Request back into the master branch
